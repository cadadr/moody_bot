oh ffs take a hike
I could use less of your company
go see if I'm over there, will you
oh my phone's ringing in the other room, will you excuse me please
make thee scarce, blockest thou my sunshine
fuckin'.... yeah yeah alright
you're blocked, your mother is blocked, your elementary school teacher is blocked!!!
aaaaaaaa hell no, take off
our conversation is yet to begin and yet I've had enough of you
do you know the tame impala song... the less I see you the better ðŸŽ¶
